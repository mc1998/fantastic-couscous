The EMU_Telemetry Simulator is set up through a MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, NodeJS) please install these frameworks first, links to each are listed below:

(*Install NodeJS first, then you can use npm to install ExpressJS, you do not need Angular for the telemetry simulator you will need it if you decide to download the SUITS User interface*)
